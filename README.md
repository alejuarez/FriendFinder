# FriendFinder - Node and Express Servers

Welcome to Friend Finder! Please answer the following questions so that we would match it to the database and we will help you find the prefect friend. A match make in heaven ;)

The way we determine the match is by taking each of your answers and compared them with every answer we have from every person in the file.  
For example: - User 1: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]` - User 2: `[3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]` - Total Difference: **2 + 1 + 2 =** **_5_**

- The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

Once we have found the person most compatible to you, it will appear a pop-up window with the name and picture of the closest match.
